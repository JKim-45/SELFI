How to use these codes:  

- Place R codes and xlsx file in same folder  
- Open the code what you want;  
	H-E means Healthy control versus Early stage PDAC  
	H-L means Healthy control versus Late stage PDAC  
	Whole means Healthy control versus Whole PDAC  

- When you run the code, then new folder will be created and data files will be generated in that folder;  
	AUC values.xlsx - AUC values while repetition  
	auc_average.xlsx - Average AUC and 95% CI  
	Average_ROC_data_AuNPs - Averaged ROC curve with AuNPs (criterion, FPR, and TPR)  
	Average_ROC_data_ELISA - Averaged ROC curve with ELISA (criterion, FPR, and TPR)  
	Average_ROC_data_SELFI - Averaged ROC curve with SELFI (criterion, FPR, and TPR)  
	AuNPs_ROC_ ~~ - ROC curve with AuNPs at ~~th repetition  
	ELISA_ROC_ ~~ - ROC curve with ELISA at ~~th repetition  
	SELFI_ROC_ ~~ - ROC curve with SELFI at ~~th repetition
